				<h1>Triumph and Tragedy: The Space Race</h1>
			</header>
			<hr>
			<span class = "inlineheading">Thesis</span>
			<p>The Space Race was an 18 year competition between the Soviet Union and the United States to see who could dominate each other in space exploration. Although space exploration was a relatively new concept at the time, both nations had set forth bold plans to go to the moon and beyond. In the end, the Space Race had stood out as one of Humanity’s greatest <strong>triumphs</strong> due to rapid technological advancement and one of humanity’s greatest <strong>tragedies</strong> due to the cease in technological innovation.</p>

				<p>Wernher Von Braun was the lead rocket designer for the United States Space Program during the Space Race.</p>
				<p>During the Second World War, Wernher Von Braun was the lead engineer for Nazi Germany to design ballistic missiles. The most notable rocket he had designed while in Nazi Germany was the V-2 Ballistic Missile. Wernher Von Braun had surrendered to the United States when the war was over.</p>

					<strong><p>In spring 1945, the U.S. Army moved him about 120 subordinates to El Paso, Texas, to form the core of a new rocket group.</b></p></strong>

				<p>Sergei Korolev was the Soviet Union's leading rocket engineer during the Space Race.</p>
				<p>During the 1930s, the vision of space travel had captivated Sergei Korolev's imagination. He lead a group of Soviet engineers to explore liquid-fueled rockets. However, his ambitious dreams of space travel did not save him or his team from a political repression campaign in the Soviet Union which is now known as the Great Purge.</p>

				<p>After Korolev's release from the gulag in 1944, he was chosen to be the lead engineer in the Soviet Union's ballistic missile program under the Soviet Premiere, Nikita Khruschev.</p>

					<p>Sergei Korolev had convinced the high ranks of the Soviet Union to fund the first artifical satelite, Sputnik, to test if his R-7 Ballistic Missile would work. Sputnik's onboard equipment only included a radio transmitter to emit pings. After the successful launch of Sputnik, the news had been spread by the public media about the Soviet Union's <strong>triumph</strong>.</p>
					<center>
							<strong><p>New York Times and the Washington Post ran headlines that were as large as those that announced the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor. Newsweek discarded 20 tons of paper to run a last minute cover feature on Sputnik that included articles addressing "The Red Conquest," and "Why we are lagging." Many journalists, teachers, and politicians were alarmed that the Soviets had 'beaten' the Americans.</p></strong>
							<h2>- Marta Schaff, Sputnik & the Space Race.</h2>
					</center>
					<p>Sergei's work on the R-7 ballistic missile that was used to launch Sputnik had pleased Nikita Khruschev, the Soviet Premiere, who continued to encourage Korolev.</p>
					<p>Political pressure was mounting on the United States due to the recent technological advancements made by the Soviet Union, as the newly developed rocket technology can be used against the United States in the form of ICBMs.</p>

					<p>As a result, the political pressure building in the United States had forced them to develop an artificial satellite and launch vehicle of their own as well. After the United States Navy's failed attempt to build America's first orbiting artificial satellite, Wernher Von Braun's team were given the task to create the satellite and the rocket.</p>
					<p>The design culminated up to the Explorer 1 Satellite.</p>
					<p>However, the success of the Explorer 1 satellite would soon be short lived.</p>

					<p>On April 12, 1961, Yuri Gagarin had become the first person to enter space and had orbited for 1 hour and 48 minutes, representing another historic <strong>triumph</strong> in manned space exploration.</p>

					<p>The public media had broadcasted about Yuri Gagarin's flight in space. The tensions between the Soviet Union and the United States were higher due to the United States lagging behind.</p>

					<p>The Soviet Union had attempted to compete with the United States' Saturn V with their own N-1 rocket.

					<p>The Apollo Moon Landings have continued from Apollo 11 to Apollo 17 with the exception of Apollo 13 due to a ship failure. Budget cuts and lack of popularity of the Apollo program lead to NASA ceasing the program altogether. The <strong>near-tragic</strong> events of Apollo 13 had decreased the popularity of the Apollo program and had increased the perceived risk of the death of future Apollo astronauts.</p>

					<p>The legacy of the Space Race can still be felt through the amount of technological innovations that had benefited all of mankind and made the friendly cooperation between the United States and Russia possible.</p>

					<p>The Space Race remains as one of humanity's greatest <strong>triumphs</strong> due to the immense amount of technological innovations that had occurred in a short amount of time. The knowledge of space exploration would benefit humanity significantly to avoid certain mass-extinction events such as catastrophic meteoric impacts on Earth through the conquering of space.</p>

					<p>Not only does the Space Race remain as one of humanity's greatest triumphs, it also remains as one of humanity's greatest <strong>tragedies</strong>, since there has been little motivation due to shifted public attention to continue these advancements. The political motivation for space exploration had worn down to a halt to where funding for both the space programs of the Soviet Union and the United States had been cut severely due to the <strong>tragedies</strong> that had occurred from space exploration.</p>
