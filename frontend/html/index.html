			<p>The Space Race was a competition between two powerful nations, the Soviet Union and the United States, to see who could dominate the other in spaceflight capability. Since spaceflight was a relatively new concept at the time, it came with many triumphs and tragedies. In total, fourteen astronauts from both countries have died in the attempt to get to the moon, and only one nation was able to have gotten a human to the moon successfully. However, many technologies that have been used in modern life have had its origins dating back to the Space Race and the development of spaceflight technologies, such as the innovation of the integrated circuit and the computer. The technological innovations has had its origins from the Space Race and has influenced modern life quite significantly by providing better tools to accomplish bigger problems which resulted in one great triumph. However, the technological stagnance and budget cuts ended up halting both nation's dreams for further manned spaceflight.</p>
